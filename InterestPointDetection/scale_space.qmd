# Scale Space

The main idea behind a scale space is that different levels of gaussian smoothing will 
present different features. So when we use the gaussian filter or it's derivatives, we 
can use different scales (sigma values) to get different responses from features


We can use the scale space to approximate the LoG using a difference of 2 gaussian blur
levels. This is called Difference of Gaussian (DoG)

## Scale Space of an Image

```{python}
from skimage import data, io
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image, ImageFilter
import cv2 as cv
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.ndimage import gaussian_filter, gaussian_laplace
```

```{python}
# We'll be working on this image
image = data.camera()
io.imshow(image)
io.show()
```

Apply a Gaussian filter to an image over multiple scales to create a scale space
```{python}
k = np.sqrt(2.)
sigma = 1.2
scale_space_size = 4

blur = []
for scale in range(scale_space_size):
    blur.append(gaussian_filter(image, k**scale * sigma))


fig, axarr = plt.subplots(1, scale_space_size)
for scale in range(len(blur)):
    axarr[scale].imshow(blur[scale])
    axarr[scale].set_title(f"scale = {scale}")
```

We can now get the Difference of Gaussian
```{python}
fig, axarr = plt.subplots(1, scale_space_size - 1)
for scale in range(scale_space_size - 1):
    axarr[scale].imshow(np.subtract(blur[scale + 1], blur[scale], dtype=np.float32))
    axarr[scale].set_title(f"DoG = {scale + 1} - {scale}")
```

And this is the scale space that we now work on
